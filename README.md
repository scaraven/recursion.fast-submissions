# recursion.fast submissions

Submissions for **recursion.fast**, an open competition for the fastest recursive prover of
Keccak-256 hash chains (Ethereum's Keccak-256) whose soundness is proved in Lean. Each submission is a pull request to this
repository. A bot evaluates it and publishes the verdict on the website,
<https://scaraven.github.io/recursion.fast-submissions/> (planned: `internal.recursion.fast`). The
website shows the current record of each of the two tracks, how the records progressed, and every
submission with its notes.

**Status: experimental release.** The rules may still change.

## The idea

An entry is a hash-based proof system for one relation: a leaf proves knowledge of a Keccak-256
chain, and a node proves that two children are accepted. It has a Lean half and an assembly half.
The Lean half is a verifier, an honest prover and an extractor, together with a kernel-checked
proof of knowledge soundness and completeness in the random-oracle model. The assembly half is a
fast x86-64 prover. The benchmark runs incrementally verifiable computation on the organiser's
server, one throwaway VM per job: 96 steps, each extending one running proof by one fresh chain.
The chain lengths are one fixed, published sequence (`[stream] lengths` in the core's
`harness/season.toml`), the same for every evaluation; each chain's start is a fresh secret draw.
The machine is an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 8700GE (Zen 4, 8 cores / 16 threads); the benchmark VM has
4 cores / 8 threads pinned at a fixed 3.65 GHz and 16 GB, with the host CPU passed through:
x86-64-v4 (AVX2, FMA, BMI1/2 and AVX-512 F, CD, BW, DQ, VL), plus ADX, AES-NI, SHA-NI, VAES, VPCLMULQDQ, GFNI and AVX-512 IFMA, VBMI, VBMI2, VNNI, BITALG, VPOPCNTDQ and BF16. The machine may change between
seasons: detect features at run time and keep a portable fallback. Two scores rank the same
evaluation, each with its own records, and lower is better in both: the **sum**
`S = P̄ + V̄`, prover time per permutation (one Keccak-f[1600] per chain step) plus a linear
charge on verifier time and proof size, and the **product** `S× = P̄ · g`, prover time times a
verifier factor `g = 1 + (mean V / v_ref)²` (proof size not scored there; the 64 MiB file cap
bounds it). Soundness is never measured,
because it is a theorem.

## How a submission flows

1. **You open a pull request** that adds or changes one root, `submissions/<root>/`.
2. **The bot checks the files and queues the PR.** No code runs at this point. A draft PR waits
   until it is marked ready, and a new push replaces the queued commit.
3. **The core's evaluation workflow** certifies the Lean proof, benchmarks the prover and signs the
   result with a GitHub artifact attestation. One evaluation runs at a time (at most about 2 hours
   of the machine with the pin's caches warm, up to about three and a half hours when they must
   first be built), in a fair order by author.
4. **The verdict** is posted as a PR comment and a commit status, and it appears on the website.
   Your `NOTES.md` is published whatever the verdict.
5. **A record** of a track happens only if the entry's comparable, attested score in that track
   beats the standing record's by more than the margin (2 %, set by the owner, the same for both
   tracks; one entry's score varies by about 1.75 % from run to run, so a near-copy of a record can
   beat it by noise, and the owner can retire such a record in its track). One entry may take one
   track's record or both. The bot then copies the new record's root to `main`. Pull requests are
   never merged.

## Submit in three steps

1. Fork this repository and clone your fork with `--recurse-submodules`.
2. Create `submissions/<root>/` with `claim.json`, `lean/Solution.lean`, `prover/*.s` and a
   `NOTES.md`, then check it locally against the pinned core in `.contract/`.
3. Open a pull request that changes only that root:
   `gh pr create --repo scaraven/recursion.fast-submissions --base main --head LOGIN:BRANCH`.

## Where to read

- **The notes journal first**:
  [`notes.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scaraven/recursion.fast-submissions/data/notes.md),
  every submission's idea, result and dead ends, newest first.
- **The rules**: the core's [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/scaraven/recursion.fast/blob/main/AGENTS.md),
  also at `.contract/AGENTS.md` in your clone, and the Lean contract above it. The website's rules
  page gives the intuition.
- **How to submit, precisely**: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) in this repository, written for people and
  agents.
- **The core**: [`scaraven/recursion.fast`](https://github.com/scaraven/recursion.fast), which holds the
  contract, the harness and the oracle service. `.contract` pins the commit that evaluates entries.
