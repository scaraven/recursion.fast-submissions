# Controls for the field layer

Kernel-checked evaluations of the compiled operations on fixed inputs, positive and negative.
They pin the conventions a wrong constant would silently change: the bit order (bit `i` is `x^i`),
the base modulus (`x^64 = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1`), the extension modulus (`y^3 = y + 1`) and the
little-endian byte order.
