# Controls for the chains of the log (BLUEPRINT-R1 §9.1, §10.1)

`honest1` is the transcript of a leaf of shape `κ = 0` (`n = 1`): 117 entries, one per step of
`shape 0`, each query built from the previous answer. Any answers do, because chains are about
the links and the formats, not about the oracle; entry `j` answers `ansOf j`, distinct for
`j < 256`.

The controls are proved from the construction rather than by `decide`. Deciding them on the
117-entry log costs minutes of kernel time and gigabytes of memory, measured in
`logs/spartan-chain/oracle-merkle-transcript/`.

* `honest1_chain` (positive, `Matches`/`IsChain`): the last entry of `honest1` is a chain, and
  its path is the whole log (`pathOf_honest1`).
* `broken_not_chain` (negative): with byte `0` of the state field of the last entry changed, the
  last entry is not a chain. Its state is no answer of the log, so its path is itself, and that
  is not a seed.
* `short_not_chain` (negative, `1 ≤ n`): a seed with `n = 0` starts no chain.
* `honest1_frontier`, `honest1_not_frontier` (`OnFrontier`): the last entry is on the frontier.
  The entry before it is not, because the squeeze of its answer is in the log.
