Builds on: #11, #7, #12, #13, #15

This root continues PR #11 (`leanvm-inspired`, roll 5 = pr11-c65f417243e9); "Changes since pr11-c65f417243e9" is
relative to that evaluated version.

A recursive SNARK entry built from leanVM's proof system: binary fields, Keccak-f by GKR, a logup bus,
ring switching and stacked WHIR. It is reshaped for the contract in three ways: an extractor that decodes only
`C_rec`, with unique-decoding programs on advice; a hash-chain transcript over the signed oracle; and an in-circuit
verifier written as loop tables instead of a VM guest. From #7 it takes the core library's `WitnessSending`
relation, unchanged: that relation is the right leaf of every node and the completeness route. The prover can run
relay-echo's (#12) AVX-512VL chain kernel, and its v4 tier runs leanvm-gkr-fast's (#13) Keccak GKR with
leanvm-fast-verify's (#15) round storage (see "Changes in pr11-c65f417243e9").

Notation:
- `K = GF(2^64)` (`x^64+x^4+x^3+x+1`, CompPoly `BF64`) and `E = K[y]/(y^3+y+1)` (CompPoly `BF64.Ext3`);
  `g = x` generates `K^×`.
- `Ex` is the extractor; UD means unique decoding.
- P20 is the production parameter set and P8 the test set.
- v1 is the design of pr11-983bdcfa21d6 (chain table `CH` with committed `in`, `mid`, `Y`; `C_main` 2^26).
- [e] marks an estimate.

## Changes since pr11-c65f417243e9

pr11-c65f417243e9 was accepted on the evaluation machine: S = 3.508 (P̄ 1.684, V̄ 1.824), S× = 1.738 (mean `V`
0.119 s, g 1.032), |π| 783,192 B. This version moves `C_rec` to the Johnson radius, with a new knowledge-soundness
argument, shares address columns in the position tables and changes the prover's plumbing. The claim, the theorem's
statement, `C_main`, the chain tape, `KS`, the bus, LoopIR, the accumulator, the extractor's decoder programs and
its fuel are unchanged.

- **`C_rec` at the Johnson radius (J2′).** (fold, rate, queries) = (6, 1/4, **115**) then (4, 1/8, **77**) (were
  170 and 139 in UD), g = 14, one OOD sample after level 0 (a point in `E^13`, its answer and the intro
  polynomial), final 2^9 `E` scalars. The lists have at most 304 members at level 0 (agreement threshold 16,410 of
  2^15) and 311 at level 1; the code facts come from `codeFacts_johnson`, as for `C_main` (`LvmWhirParamsJp`).
  Model groups: queries 2^-128.75 and 2^-129.36 after the PoW discount, folds 2^-130.0 and 2^-134.5, OOD 2^-172.7.
  - *Knowledge soundness from one invariant.* A `KCert` (leanVM's `Cert` plus a luck predicate `B`) asks: `¬B`
    at the empty history, prover moves keep `¬B`, each FS group breaks `¬B` with probability `≤ εB`, and an
    accepting run that stays in `¬B` is extractable. The invariant `Inv` says: every candidate pair
    `(q_m, q_r) ∈ Λ_m × Λ_r` that is not a witness for the M3 relation fails some running claim. At the openings it splits (`openPostR_split`): either every non-good `C_rec` list
    member fails a `C_rec` claim, and the relativised WHIR invariant ("every list member off a good fold path
    violates the running claim", `stackedPrefixSpecR`, `finSuffixSpecR`) carries it to `ExtI`, where the residual
    is a good candidate's path; or every `C_main` candidate fails a `C_main` claim, and `C_main`'s opening rejects. `Inv` holds on honest runs,
    so it can never be a doom (a doom must not hold on an accepting run). It is the complement of luck instead:
    no doom (`D := ⊥`, `ε = 0`), `B := ¬Inv ∨ BL`, with `BL` the extractor's list luck. Each group's escape from
    `Inv` has the bound of the matching soundness escape: the front end's proofs with `¬Good` carried, over
    `L₀ = 98·304 = 29,792` pairs (`midSpecR_midSA`), `C_rec`'s relativised specs (`whirEps_rec20Jp`), `C_main`
    (`whirEps_main24J`). So KS costs no query, no grinding bit and no slack over soundness, only the extractor's
    list luck; soundness is the case of an empty good set. Lean:
    `kcertOfInv` (`LvmInvCert`), `psInv` (`LvmCertSOpenJ`), `kcertSJ` and `εFS_kcertSJ` (`LvmCertSKJ`):
    `εFS ≤ 0 + (7·2^-131 + 2^-132) + 2^-139 ≤ 2^-128`.
  - *Extraction without a list decoder.* From `ExtI`, the run's own values give a level-0 list member `q` with
    `GoodRec`, a level-1 list member `V` on `q`'s fold path, and the residual equal to `q`'s path. Off the list
    luck `LuckBJ` (after a fold, some list member agrees with the folded word on a column where it disagreed
    before;
    ≤ 2^-132 in Lean, `esc_luckJ_le_132`; 2^-165.4 in the model), the transcript is advice that singles out the
    member. The level-1 UD decoder `decodeRec1`, given level 1's word, `α₁` and the final polynomial, returns
    `V`'s message, which is `q`'s level-0 fold message; the level-0 decoder, given `C_rec`'s word, `α₀` and that
    message, returns `q` (`decode_SJ`; `decodeRec_of_mem`: any candidate with ≥ 2^13 agreements). `Ex` is the UD
    decoder chain on the history with no choice (`extJ_ext : (extJ …).ext = extSJ mid child := rfl`). The decoder
    programs and the fuel are unchanged; the readers' offsets moved and `computesX` was re-proved (its cost bound
    fell slightly). leanVM's Guruswami–Sudan list decoder is not needed.
  - *Interfaces.* `MidHyp.cons ≤ 2^48` (was 2^56; the real count is ≈ 1,300), so the bus batching stays within
    `εS` at `L₀ = 29,792`. `C_rec` takes at most 2^55 batched claims, so its batching `(J − 1)·304/|E|` stays
    `≤ 2^-128.75`. `midSpec1`, `resSpec` and the UD `kcertS` were removed; `ud_extract2` and the other UD helpers
    still compile, outside `certified`'s proof.
- **Shared address columns (EVD2).** The first `sh` outputs of a `BITS` class, when their cells are consecutive at
  every row (`oc j x = oc 0 x + j`), read their bus address from one fixed column `g^{oc 0 x}`, with address polynomial
  `g^j·col` (`BSpec.sh`, `hsh`; `oaddr_eval`; `out_sound`'s statement is unchanged). Q_sig's six classes, `s'` and
  the three lane classes (64/32/24 shared bits at P20) share. There is no protocol, gadget or extractor change.
  −295 `BITS` evaluations on pr11-c65f417243e9's program; the record goes 2,851 → **2,576** with J2′. Badge A/B
  (dev VM): EVD2 alone −5.5 ms median against pr11-c65f417243e9; with J2′ (13 OOD samples, 85 fewer `C_rec`
  positions) −3.0 ms (184.0 → 181.0).
- **Prover plumbing (proofs byte-identical).**
  - The `Readd` discrete-log tables are cached per program; they were built four times per step. The opening
    basis's setup (2,124 claims, 884 patterns) is hashed and runs in parallel. Together: −0.05 s of P̄ on the
    dev VM [model on measured phase deltas].
  - Worker count: `prover setup` times a whole P20 step at `n = 2^17` (warm-up, then timed; order hi, mid, lo,
    lo, mid, hi; best of two) for `hi = min(CPUs, 8)`, `3·hi/4` and `hi/2`. A smaller count wins only if it is
    ≥ 3 % faster than `hi`. A proof-hash mismatch, a failure or a timeout falls back to `hi`, and the stream
    clamps the count to the CPUs. Roll 5's probe (the tape GKR at 2^14, 8 or 4) wrote 8 on fewer than 8 CPUs.
    Counts below 2 are dropped; 1–2 CPUs are not timed. On 4 CPUs P̄ drops 3.3 % [model on measured fits, dev
    VM]; on 8 nothing changes; the 4C/8T evaluation VM is
    untested (0 to −6 % [e]).
- **Re-frozen record:** P20 (21, 1, 16, **2,576**), PUB 125. **|π| 700,696 B** (−82,496 B, −10.5 %), **qS 7,426**
  (8,295), signed file 1,921,175 B.
- **Checks.** `lake build RFSubmission` (2,822 jobs); `certified`, `certificateFin`, `kcertSJ`, `εFS_kcertSJ`,
  `extJ`, `psInv`, `computesX` use `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`; `staticOkB` is true. The Lean
  `V_S` accepts the native prover's P20 and P8 streams and the linked `.s` prover's P20 stream; tampered proofs
  are rejected, including `C_rec`'s OOD answer.
- **Measured, local season shape** (dev VM, 8 pinned CPUs, caps unchanged, one run): **ACCEPT**, S =
  **4.99** (P̄ 3.30, V̄ 1.69), S× = **3.40** at the local `v_ref` (1,034 ms); mean `V` **184.6 ms** (median
  182.9 ms); steps 2.5–8.7 s, step 1 5.6 s; fit `P(n) = 1.68 + 6.93·n/2^20` s; prover peak 6.81 GiB; `build_s`
  591 s, comparator 534 s (cap 600). Against pr11-c65f417243e9 on the same harness: S −4.7 %, S× −2.6 %, mean `V`
  −12.3 ms, P̄ −2.1 % (one run each).
- **Expected on the evaluation machine [e]:** pr11-c65f417243e9's evaluation-to-local ratios (P̄ 0.500, `V`
  0.602) give S ≈ 3.31 and S× ≈ 1.70 (−5.8 % and −2.5 % against its evaluation); pr11-9e756ce6880a's (P̄
  0.51–0.54, `V` 0.57) give S ≈ 3.31–3.41 and S× ≈ 1.72–1.83.

## Changes in pr11-c65f417243e9 (since pr11-9e756ce6880a)

pr11-9e756ce6880a (the digest-only tape) was accepted on the evaluation machine: S = 4.374 (P̄ 1.892, V̄ 2.482),
S× = 1.993 (mean `V` 0.152 s, g 1.053), |π| 1,094,248 B. pr11-c65f417243e9 changed the WHIR openings, the
circuit's position tables, the native `V` and the prover's plumbing.

- **Grinding, g = 14, on every WHIR level** (`C_main`'s three, `C_rec`'s two). After a level's cap (or its final
  scalars) `V` draws one separator sample and discards it, reads a nonce (one `E` scalar, 24 B), then draws the
  PoW challenge `c` and requires `eToNat c < 2^(192−g)`, that is, lane 2 of the answer `< 2^50`. The positions
  come from the challenges after `c`.
  - *Soundness accounting.* The nonce is a prover move (`read`), so the query `st ‖ nonce` opens a move-free group:
    the PoW challenge, the positions, `λ` and the openings. The FS compiler's potential (`kstate_of_kcert`,
    `LvmPotential`) charges a group once, at the fresh query that opens it, and every later query of the group is
    a continuation. So each nonce attempt is one fresh query, charged the group's escape once, and that escape is
    `2^-g·eQuery` (`escRet_powCheck_le`: `2^(192−g)` passing challenges, and the positions are drawn after `c`
    inside the same group). No `grind` node is used, so `NoGrind` still holds and the compiler is unchanged. The
    separator makes every attempt a full oracle query (`st ‖ nonce`, 56 B) with no midstate over the cap.
  - *Circuit.* A `BITS` class `powSpec` (one row per opening) reads lane 2 of each PoW answer as a `(64 − g)`-bit
    field, and `powG` asserts the lane equals it (`pw20`, `powOKR_of`).
  - *Prover.* A multithreaded nonce search, 2^14 expected attempts per level: 12–35 ms per P20 proof with four
    levels [measured], ≈ 15–45 ms with five [e].
- **`C_main` at the Johnson radius, with OOD (J1).** Folds 6/4/4 and rates 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 as before; **230/115/77
  queries** (were 311/191/156). Levels 0 and 1 send an OOD sample after the next cap: a point `z ∈ E^κ`, the answer
  `y` and the intro polynomial; the final weight takes the claim `(λ, eq(z, ·))` before `(λ², W)` (leanVM's
  order).
  - *The list-decoding bound.* `codeFacts_johnson` (`LvmMcaJohnson`) gives each Johnson level's code facts from two
    proved theorems:
    - Haböck's strong mutual correlated agreement at the Johnson radius (`strong_mutual_johnson`): for `2 ≤ k`,
      `0 < η ≤ 1/4`, `ηn ≥ 1` and `(k − 1)·n ≤ (A − 4ηn)²`, fewer than `johnsonThreshold k n (n − A) η` fold
      challenges admit a proximate word that the pair's codewords do not explain;
    - the interleaved Johnson list bound (`card_le_listBound`): within `E = n − A` column errors of a linear code
      of distance `d` (`d = n − k + 1` for RS, `rsCode_minDist`) lie at most `⌊n(d − E)/(nd − 2nE + E²)⌋`
      codewords.
    - The per-level constants (`A`, `L`, `M`, slack `η`) are `norm_num` facts (`LvmWhirCodeJ`); the lists have
      at most 98, 390 and 646 members (level 0: `candidates_main24J_ncard_le`).
    - leanVM's OOD and list-to-one WHIR steps (its `Whir/Sound`, re-ported with OOD in `LvmWhirOod`,
      `LvmWhirEscapeJ`, `LvmWhirProgJ`, `LvmWhirSpecJ`) carry the bound into the opening. With `ood = false` the
      new program is the UD one (`verifyStackedJ_ud`), so the UD refinements stand.
  - *Provenance.* Both theorems are from longfellow-zk's Lean formalisation (`formal/ligero` @ 1c06629, Copyright
    Google LLC, Apache-2.0), as ported to flat modules at Lean 4.34.1 by the Flock entry (`flock-recursive`
    @ 1b74a2a2). They are vendored as `LvmJB*` (30 modules, 7.8 k lines, all in `Solution`'s closure), with module
    and namespace renames only. `LICENSE-longfellow` in this root holds the licence and the change list. Flock's
    `LvmLJ*` lemmas (5 modules) are vendored under the same licence for the list-version extractor, which is not
    used yet.
  - *Soundness accounting.* Per group, before the `2^-14` discount: folds `≤ 2^-130`, OOD points `≤ 2^-170`,
    positions + `λ` + openings 2^-114.30, 2^-114.80 and (final) 2^-115.44; after it **2^-128.30, 2^-128.80,
    2^-129.44**. Lean bounds every group by `εS = 7·2^-131 = 2^-128 − 2^-131` (`whirEps_main24J`), luck by 2^-132
    and the hash by 2^-139: `εFS ≤ 7·2^-131 + 2^-132 + 2^-139 ≤ 2^-128` (`εFS_kcertOfSpec`). The other groups
    pay the union over `C_main`'s candidates (`candPairs_ncard_le`: `L₀ = 98`; `C_rec`'s candidate is unique).
    They stay `≤ 2^-129` because `MidHyp.cons ≤ 2^56` (was 2^60) keeps `98·ξ` small and `C_main` takes at most
    2^40 batched claims.
- **A second WHIR level on `C_rec`, still in unique decoding.** `C_rec` now opens in two UD levels, (fold, rate,
  queries) = (6, 1/4, 170) then (4, 1/8, 139), caps 2^7 and 2^7, final 2^9 `E` scalars (was one level and a 2^13
  final). Level 1 commits one word (`RecCommitsOne`), and `C_main` opens after it (`cfgMain24J 3`).
  - *Soundness.* Level 1's fold is `≤ 2^-166` per challenge, and both query groups are `≤ 2^-115` before the
    discount, `≤ 2^-129` after it (`eQuery_rec20G`, `whirEps_rec20G`). The doom gains `midSpec1` (level 1's
    commitment is far from its code, `MidDoomUd`) and level 1's residual; luck is `LuckB0 ∨ LuckB1` (≤ 2^-132).
  - *Extraction.* `ud_extract2` turns "no doom at either level and no luck" into the unique good word and the
    unique level-1 codeword `V` with `joinMsg (decode V) = foldMsg α₀ q` (`ud_extract_rec20`). `Ex` first decodes
    level 1 (`decodeRec1`, ≈ 2^29.8 steps), then level 0 as before; the fixed cost stays below 2^38 and the fuel is
    unchanged.
- **Shared position-bit tables (EV-DIET).** The circuit decomposes every Merkle position into bits in `BITS`
  tables. They had one class per (opening, answer lane); now each answer lane has one class for all openings,
  which stacks the openings' rows (P20: 107/97/27 outputs on 100/100/32 rows) and sends a spare cell where a
  column is not the row's own output (`LvmQAsmLay`: `posRows`, `posSpec`; `posSpecs_hit` carries the old
  per-opening facts with unchanged statements). `Q_link`'s cells and rows are unchanged. **Table evaluations
  4,299 → 2,851** (BITS 3,005 → 1,571; 4,017 before `C_rec`'s second level), so −34.8 KB of `π` and fewer
  columns for `V`'s `Φ̃` sweep and table sumcheck.
- **Faster native `V` (`VS20G`).** `Solution` ships `subG staticOkB VS20G` (`LvmVFast2`), and `certified` rewrites
  `VS20G_eq : VS20G = VS20F` into `certificateFin`. Three levers: non-uniform group leaves are evaluated once per
  stride class (`nuOf`, `classes_spec`, `grpEvalGN_eq`); table claims share `eq(z, x.take τ)` per table run
  (`SClaim`, `decideProgS_eq`); leaf MLEs with ≥ 9 variables use a 64-entry `eq` table and one `E × K` dot per block
  (`mleF_split`). On roll 4's proofs they save 26 ms per check (242.7 → 216.4 ms, badge median, dev VM). `V` is now
  arithmetic-bound (`FK.mul` 44 % of self time).
- **Prover plumbing (proofs byte-identical).**
  - The recursion tables' static read counts are computed once per program, and each build fills value and count
    columns per piece on ≤ 6 threads (`tables_ext`; the serial pass stays as the `LVM_TABLES_REF=1` oracle).
    The witness phase is 0.06 s shorter per step on the dev VM.
  - `prover setup` picks the worker count (8 or 4) by timing the tape GKR at 2^14 in `tsel` children, requiring
    equal GKR claims, and writes it to `lvm-threads`; each step reads it.
  - The chain walk times two kernels before `ready` and takes relay-echo's (#12) AVX-512VL chain kernel
    (`prover/tools/gen_vlasm.py`, Apache-2.0, vendored; `keccak_vl.rs` generated from it; `LICENSE`) only if it is
    ≥ 3 % faster than leanVM's `keccak_f`. The dev VM picks leanVM's kernel and 8 workers, so these two choices gain
    nothing there by construction; Zen 4 with SMT may choose otherwise.
- **The v4 tier's Keccak GKR is #13's.** On v4 (AVX-512 with GFNI, VBMI and VPCLMULQDQ: the evaluation machine),
  the tape and `KS` GKRs run leanvm-gkr-fast's (#13) re-vendor of gattaca-com/leanVM `pr/all` (MIT/Apache-2.0,
  `src/lv/keccak_gkr_v4/`, #13's per-file headers kept, `src/lv/PATCHES.md`), storing every round as
  leanvm-fast-verify (#15) measured faster on Zen 4. v2 and v4p keep leanVM 0b850750's GKR, and their `.s` is
  unchanged by it. v4's proofs are byte-identical to the other tiers' under Intel SDE (P8 and P20). Under SDE it
  retires 7–19 % fewer instructions per GKR; its time can only be measured on the evaluation machine
  (−0.2 to −0.3 s of P̄ [e]).
- **Re-frozen record:** P20 (21, 1, 16, **2,851**), PUB 127. **|π| 783,192 B** (pr11-9e756ce6880a: 1,094,248,
  −28.4 %), **qS 8,295** (9,916 in pr11-9e756ce6880a; 7,440 with grinding and Johnson `C_main` alone, before `C_rec`'s
  second level), signed file 2,144,991 B. `Q` is 4.89 M words. The table phase has 16 rounds
  (`dk` 12, `D = 28`).
- **Result.** Local season shape (dev VM): S 5.24 (P̄ 3.37, V̄ 1.87), S× 3.49, mean `V` 196.9 ms; `build_s` 601 s,
  comparator 509 s. Evaluation machine: **ACCEPT, S = 3.508 (P̄ 1.684, V̄ 1.824), S× = 1.738** (mean `V` 0.119 s),
  against the projected 3.51–3.61 and 1.77–1.87.

## Changes in pr11-9e756ce6880a (since pr11-2f57ce79224a)

- **The chain became a digest-only tape.** Only lanes 0–3 of each row's Keccak-f output are committed (v1's `CH`
  committed `in`, `mid` and `Y`); row `i`'s input `Pad43(D[i−1])` is virtual. leanVM's Keccak GKR runs as one
  segment of depth 24, and a 20-round wiring sumcheck with the public kernel `ι(x + 1)·[x + 1 ≤ m]` (evaluated by
  automata over `m`'s bits), a slot reduction and one ring switch tie its input claim to the committed digests.
  `chain_of_tape` gives `chainEnd s n = h`.
- **`C_main` shrank from 2^26 to 2^24 words**, with three WHIR levels instead of four; `|π|` 1,181,488 → 1,094,248 B.
- The prover's fixed part shrank with `C_main`; the recursion-table build starts once `h` is known.
- Local season shape: S = 6.26 (P̄ 3.70, V̄ 2.56), S× = 3.94, mean `V` 268.6 ms; `build_s` 507 s, comparator 464 s.
  Evaluation machine: S = 4.374, S× = 1.993.

## Changes in pr11-2f57ce79224a (since pr11-983bdcfa21d6)

pr11-983bdcfa21d6 was accepted on the evaluation machine: S = 10.17 (P̄ 6.88, V̄ 3.29), S× = 8.19 (mean V 0.288 s,
g 1.19), mean |π| 1,180,192 B. pr11-2f57ce79224a gated the chain link by `n` (the prover's work grows with `n`),
added prover levers (bytes unchanged) and fast verifier twins proved equal to the code they replace (`VS20F_eq`;
505 → 264 ms per check). Local season shape: S = 8.76 (P̄ 6.05, V̄ 2.71), S× = 6.46.

## Idea

### Trust surface: what is proved, and what is checked when V runs

- **The theorem.** `certified : CertificateR declared submission` with `submission = subG staticOkB VS20G`
  (`LvmFinCert.certificateFin`, after `VS20G_eq : VS20G = VS20F`). It uses only the axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
  `Quot.sound`. There is no `sorry`, no `native_decide` and no added `axiom`.
- **The claim.** Knowledge error 2^-128, completeness error 0, `qV = 16,384`,
  `fuel t = 2^46 + 8192·t`.
- **Proved in Lean, with no hypothesis left open.**
  - KS of the IOP: leanVM's doom-certificate framework used with no doom; the luck is "the invariant broke, or
    the extractor's list luck" (`kcertOfInv`, `kcertSJ`); the self-fold accumulator (A23).
  - The generic FS compiler from a doom certificate to the library's `KState`, which gives `KS`.
  - The node relation from the tables: chain (`chain_of_tape`), sponge, WOTS, and the child's `acc` through
    `loopir_sound`, `qlink_sound`, `qsig_sound` and `harith_core`/`harith20`.
  - The native `V` refines the compiled IOP verifier (`refines_VSL`, `VS20F_eq`, `VS20G_eq`).
  - The extractor's output and cost (`computesX` at the declared fuel).
  - The Johnson code facts of every WHIR level (`codeFacts_johnson`), from the vendored longfellow-zk theorems
    (`LvmJB*`; `LICENSE-longfellow`).
- **Discharged by kernel `decide` at the frozen record.** These are facts about the concrete program `Q`
  and its tables:
  - `fitsR`, the table shapes and the `chkB` checks (`chkFit_P20`);
  - the layout and input-map fields (`LvmQAsmFacts*`);
  - the cell bounds of the position fields (`posCellsB_P20`);
  - the positions and lanes of every phase (`harNum20`, `okE_P20`, `posLanesR20/M20/B20`, `hbs20`).
- **Checked when V runs: the A24 guard.** Five static facts are not kernel-decidable within the caps:
  - no computed-address read in `Q_arith`;
  - `Q.wf`;
  - grouping and injectivity of the table pieces;
  - well-formedness of the claim lists.

  The table builder's `List.mergeSort` is well-founded recursion and gets stuck in the kernel. A
  structural sort is OOM-killed at 12 GB. So these facts are one closed `Bool`, `staticOkB`.
  - The submitted verifier is `if staticOkB then VS20G else reject every 'S' proof`.
  - The certificate case-splits on `staticOkB` without evaluating it. In the `true` branch,
    `staticFacts` gives the facts, and the full proof applies. In the `false` branch, the `S` branch
    accepts nothing, and KS holds trivially (`certificateR_reject`, εFS ≤ 2^-139).
  - **Soundness therefore holds for either value.** Only completeness of the native prover depends on
    `staticOkB = true`. The compiled V evaluates it once per process (1.5 s), and it is `true` at P20:
    every e2e run and badge check accepts.
- **Completeness** is the `W` kind (`P := encode`, error 0). The SNARK prover is tested by the harness,
  not proved complete.
- **Soundness error.**
  - Model: ≈ 2^-128.30. The dominant term is `C_main` level 0's query group (230 positions at the Johnson
    radius, after the 2^-14 PoW discount); the table below has every group. KS adds only the extractor's list luck,
    2^-165.4: the invariant's escapes have the soundness escapes' bounds.
  - Lean: `εFS = ε + εB + hash ≤ 0 + (7·2^-131 + 2^-132) + 2^-139 ≤ 2^-128` (`kcertSJ`, `εFS_kcertSJ`). There is
    no doom, so `ε = 0`. `εB = εI + εL`: `εI = εS = 7·2^-131` bounds every group's escape from the invariant, and
    `εL = 2^-132` the extractor's list luck (`esc_luckJ_le_132`). Inside `εI`: `C_main`'s groups
    (`whirEps_main24J`: folds ≤ 2^-130, OOD ≤ 2^-170, query groups 2^-128.30, 2^-128.80, 2^-129.44), `C_rec`'s
    (`whirEps_rec20Jp`: folds ≤ 2^-130, OOD ≤ 2^-170, query groups ≤ 7·2^-131), the two batchings, and every
    other group with the union over `L₀ = 98·304 = 29,792` candidate pairs (`kg_errsJ2`, `bus_errsJ2`).
  - The chain's mask adds no error term: `n` is in the seed query, so every kernel is fixed before any
    challenge, and `V` evaluates `K̃_ch`, the threshold sum and `ι` exactly. Every tape challenge (`r`, lane
    samples, the 24 layers' RMFE points (46/|E|) and rounds, the wiring and slot rounds (2/|E|), the ring
    switch) escapes with ≤ 2^-164 per fresh query after the union over the 29,792 pairs, far below the WHIR
    query groups.
  - The hash term covers collisions, state repeats and 32-byte window hits at any offset of any query.

### Construction

**Tree shape: one SNARK per step.** Every output is `nodeStmt c_L (leafStmt h n)`.
- The right child is a witness-sending leaf `⟨encode (leaf s n), [], σ_leaf⟩`. `(s, n, h, σ_leaf)` are in
  the clear; `V` checks `σ_leaf` natively, and the SNARK proves `chainEnd s n = h`.
- The left child is the previous signed proof `(π', tr', σ')`. It is committed, and it is verified in the
  circuit.

A flag `b` selects leaf mode (`b = 0`, step 1's first proof) or node mode. There is one shape and one
schedule, so every proof has the same size and makes the same queries. The chain tape always has
2^20 rows; the rows `i ≥ n` hold the zero input, so the prover's work grows with `n`. `traceDigest []` is
constant, so one `σ_leaf` (one SIGN) serves the whole stream, and one WOTS walk per proof remains. A `W` proof never starts with `'S'` (`encode_first_byte`), so `V`
dispatches on `π[0]`.

**Chain tape (2^20 rows, only the digest `D[4]` committed).**
- Row `i`'s input is virtual: `Pad43(s)` for `i = 0`, `Pad43(D[i−1])` for `1 ≤ i ≤ m = n − 1`, zero for `i ≥ n`.
  `Pad43(d)` is the block `0x43 ‖ d`, so lane `j` is `(d_j << 8) | (d_{j−1} >> 56)`. That is not `K`-linear:
  multiplying by `x^8` reduces modulo the field polynomial and carries nothing into the next word.
- `D = Keccak-f(in)[0..4)` is proved by leanVM's GKR (RMFE χ), one segment of 24 rounds, from an output claim on
  `D̃` plus 21 free scalars for the other lanes. The GKR ends in a claim on the inputs, weighted by bit positions.
- A wiring sumcheck (20 rounds) turns that input claim into a bitwise claim on `D` (the `Pad43` shift is a
  shift of bit positions, `ω(8 + p)`), with the public kernel `ι(x + 1)·[x + 1 ≤ m]` and the constants of
  `Pad43(s)` and `c43`. `V` evaluates the kernel and the threshold sum by small automata over `m`'s bits. A slot
  reduction and one ring switch tie the bitwise value to 64 bit-slice claims on `D`.
- The boundary is `D̃(bits(m)) = h`, and `chain_of_tape` gives `chainEnd s n = h`. The dead rows carry no
  statement; the prover folds them in closed form.

**Sponge table `KS` (2^15 rows).** The same GKR (two 12-round segments, `in`, `mid` and `Y` committed), with a
word-linear sponge link. It holds the child's
trace sponge (its message lanes are `C_rec`'s stream columns), one WOTS walk (399 + 32 + 16 rows) and the
child's statement hashes. Six `BITS` tables decompose words for the unaligned prefixes, the WOTS
digits, the positions and the range checks.

**Two commitments.**
- `C_main`: 2^24 `K` words (`D`, `KS`, then the recursion tables), never decoded.
- `C_rec`: 2^19 words, holding the child's trace as 17 lane columns plus `σ'`. It is the only thing `Ex`
  decodes.

Decoding `C_main` would cost ≈ 2^50.6 `K` products [e] (v1's 2^52.6 at 2^26, scaled), against a fuel cap of
`2^48 + 2^16·t`.

**Stacked WHIR at the Johnson radius on both commitments, with grinding.**
- `C_main`: folds 6/4/4, rates 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 230/115/77 queries, caps 2^8/2^7/2^7, final 2^10 `E` scalars.
  Levels 0–1 send an OOD sample. The lists have at most 98, 390 and 646 members (`codeFacts_johnson`: the Johnson
  MCA and list bounds of the vendored longfellow-zk proofs). `C_main` is never decoded, so its lists cost `Ex`
  nothing.
- `C_rec`: fold 6, rate 1/4, 115 queries; then fold 4, rate 1/8, 77 queries; an OOD sample after level 0; final
  2^9 `E` scalars in the clear. Lists of at most 304 and 311 members.
- Every level grinds 14 bits: a separator sample, a nonce, a PoW challenge whose lane 2 is `< 2^50`, then the
  positions. The nonce opens the level's query group, which the FS compiler charges once (`2^-14·eQuery`).

**The extractor decodes `C_rec` with UD programs on advice.** An accepting run that keeps the invariant ends at
a residual on a good list member's fold path (see "Changes since pr11-c65f417243e9"), and off list luck the
transcript singles that member out. `Ex` first decodes level 1's committed word against the final polynomial to
the level-0 fold message `f₁` (`decodeRec1`, ≈ 2^29.8 steps; it needs 2^9 agreeing positions, and the Johnson
threshold 1,451 gives them). Then it folds `C_rec`'s word, finds the agreement set against `Enc(f₁)`, interpolates
the 64 rows on 2^13 agreeing positions (barycentric, with shared weights) and back-substitutes into the novel
basis. The fixed cost stays below 2^38 steps, under `fuel_base = 2^46`. No list is ever enumerated, so the
extractor's cost is the UD one, while the proof pays only Johnson-radius query counts.

**Fiat–Shamir is a hash chain over the contract oracle.**
- `q₀ = "lvm/1\0\0"`, then the seed `a₀ ‖ header`.
- Each FS query is `st ‖ pending messages` and yields `st'`. The challenge is lanes 0–2 of `st'`; a
  positions query yields 8 positions.
- Merkle leaves (512 B or 384 B) and nodes (64 B) are queries, and paths stop at the cap.
- There are no tags: query classes are told apart by length, and the trace is lane-aligned, so the
  circuit reads it as `K` words.

**Verifier circuit: LoopIR, not a VM guest.** `Q = Q_link ++ Q_sig ++ Q_arith` runs the child's verifier
on the child's trace:
- `Q_link`: the trace follows the schedule. FS states chain, nodes hold the previous answer, paths end at
  the absorbed cap, and positions are the answer's bits. Answers are read, never hashed.
- `Q_sig`: the WOTS walk to `vk`, and the child's header and statement.
- `Q_arith`: `V_S`'s accept bit. It covers the bus GKR, table sumcheck, accumulator fold, the tape's GKR
  (24 layers) and wiring, `KS`'s GKR and link, two ring switches, every claim, and both WHIR openings with
  their OOD and PoW checks.

Blocks are row templates over loop dimensions with affine addresses `A·g^{Σ s_d j_d}`, so `V` evaluates a
block's fixed columns in closed form. Rows of one shape are grouped into power-of-two tables. Every
operand is a read on leanVM's `g`-power memory bus (logup with counts, a grand-product GKR, one table
sumcheck). `loopir_sound` is generic: table constraints, a balanced bus and nonzero counts imply that
the committed cells are `interp Q`'s cells and its assertions hold. Assertions are gated by `b`.

**The recursion fixed point: a self-fold accumulator (A23).** A recursive verifier must check the
fixed-column claims of its own program. Two alternatives fail:
- Evaluating them in the circuit (self-evaluation) needs ≥ 1.5–2.5 M extra words.
- Plain deferral, where the parent folds the child's claims, has no sound fold challenge. The child's
  trace is adversarial (KS is for every `vk`), and the parent's transcript comes after the commitment.

So every `S` proof folds its incoming accumulator `acc_in = (pt ∈ E^28, y)` with its own fixed claims in
its own transcript:
1. draw `κ ∈ E^11` and set `y_own = Σ_k eq(κ, k)·v_fix[k]`;
2. read a degree-28 line polynomial `h` with `h(0) = acc_in.y` and `h(1) = y_own`;
3. draw `t` and set `acc_out = (line(t), h(t))`.

`V` checks only `Φ̃(acc_out.pt) = acc_out.y` natively, in one sweep over the fixed columns. The parent's
circuit (`Q_acc`, 53 k words) recomputes the child's `acc_out` deterministically from the child's trace
and asserts that it equals the parent's `acc_in`, which is in the header and the seed. The new escapes
are ≤ 2^-192 per `κ_j` and ≤ 28/|E| for `t`, so ε is unchanged. One `Φ` serves every proof, and the
program need not be a fixed point of itself.

**Native `V`.** Direct functional Lean on `UInt64` field kernels proved equal to CompPoly. It does not
interpret `Q`: `harith_core` proves that `Q_arith`'s rows imply `decideCore` and the accumulator equation.
The compiled `VS20F` shares the header-independent table parts across checks and is proved equal to the
specified `VS20` (`VS20F_eq`). The shipped `VS20G` (`LvmVFast2`) evaluates group leaves once per stride class,
shares `eq` per table run and blocks leaf MLEs, and is proved equal to `VS20F` (`VS20G_eq`).

**Prover, dev VM.** QEMU, 8 threads, shared host. Its cpuid hides PCLMULQDQ, but the instruction executes;
VPCLMULQDQ and GFNI do not, so the evaluation variant v4 cannot start there. The runs use the dev variant
v4p (AVX-512 + PCLMUL) and the shipped binary with the embedded program blob. The P8 and P20 streams
(1–3 steps; children with n = 1, 200,000 and 2^20 at P20, 1, 511 and 512 at P8) are accepted by the Lean `V_S`,
and tampered ones (n ± 1, a byte of the tape's `r`, its scalars, its lane-challenge message and its GKR, the wire's
messages, `KS`'s `r`, the OOD answers and intro scalars, the PoW lanes) are rejected. Sparse and dense (`LVM_PGATE=dense`) proofs are byte-identical.
- Local season shape: step 1 **5.6 s**; later steps **2.5–8.7 s**; a fit over the stream gives
  `P(n) ≈ 1.68 + 6.93·n/2^20` s (pr11-c65f417243e9: 1.78 + 6.83; pr11-9e756ce6880a: 2.04 + 7.06). On the
  evaluation machine the fits were 0.97 + 3.19·n/2^20 s (pr11-c65f417243e9) and 1.04 + 3.78·n/2^20 s
  (pr11-9e756ce6880a).
- Peak RSS: **6.81 GiB** (cap 11).
- The nonce search takes 12–35 ms per proof with four levels (measured before `C_rec`'s second level), ≈ 15–45 ms
  with five [e].
- The fixed part (≈ 1.7 s) is mostly the 2^24 commitment (bound by the oracle's Merkle hashing), `KS`'s GKR, the
  bus and tables, and the opening. The tape's GKR is ≈ 0.23 s + 8.6 s per 2^20 rows, the same as v1's depth
  12 × 2 segments.
- Zen 4 [e]: the GFNI/VPCLMULQDQ tiers make the GKR 2–3× faster.

**Verifier**, measured on the dev VM (one core):
- **184.6 ms per check** (harness mean, local season shape; median 182.9, p10 176.6, p90 194.9 ms).
  pr11-c65f417243e9: 196.9 ms (evaluation machine: 119 ms); pr11-9e756ce6880a: 268.6 ms (152 ms);
  pr11-983bdcfa21d6: 506 ms.
- Same-session A/B of the badge's `check` (CPU 8, timing lock, 24 checks a side): 184.0 → 181.0 ms median against
  pr11-c65f417243e9: the shared address columns (−5.5 ms alone) net of J2′'s OOD sample (+1 to +3 ms [e]).
- Start-up is not charged; it is 10.7–11.4 s per process on the loaded dev VM (`staticOkB`, shared table parts,
  caches).

**Score.** On the evaluation machine pr11-983bdcfa21d6 scored S = 10.17 and S× = 8.19, pr11-9e756ce6880a
S = 4.374 and S× = 1.993, pr11-c65f417243e9 S = 3.508 and S× = 1.738, against #7's S = 105.9 and S× = 505.8.

**Error budget (model, P20, per fresh query, log₂).** The groups outside WHIR carry the union over the
`98·304 = 29,792` candidate pairs (+14.9); the WHIR query groups include the 2^-14 PoW discount.

**Extractor.** `fuel = 2^46 + 8192·t`; the decode's fixed cost (both `C_rec` levels, ≤ 2^38 steps) is 2^8 below
`fuel_base`.

**Lean.** 576 flat modules, ≈ 168 k lines; `Solution`'s import closure holds 545 of them (2,790 build jobs in the
harness), of which 30 are the vendored `LvmJB*`. In v1, comparator time was cut from 705 s to 462 s on the dev VM by proof-only changes
(`rfl`-lemma `simp` replays, one-pass checkers).

## What failed, and why

- **leanVM's extractor.**
  - Guruswami–Sudan list decoding has a proved cost of ≤ 2^81 + …, and its cone is 443 modules /
    133 k lines.
  - Even at multiplicity 1 (Berlekamp–Welch), 64 lanes × 2^55 = 2^61 is about 2^12 over the
    `2^48 + 2^16·t` cap.
  - Hence `Ex` decodes only `C_rec`, and only with UD decoders: first `C_rec` in UD and `C_main` at the Johnson
    radius with grinding (|π| −16 %; −28.4 % with `C_rec`'s second level and the shared position tables), now
    both at the Johnson radius, with the transcript as advice (−36.0 % against pr11-9e756ce6880a).
  - ArkLib's Johnson MCA closure (300 modules / 80 k lines) is off the import allowlist anyway; the vendored
    longfellow-zk proofs need only Mathlib.
- **A relativised doom for Johnson `C_rec` (pr11-c65f417243e9).** The list extractor needs "the transcript
  ends in a fold of a good candidate", but that predicate holds on honest runs, and a `KCert`'s doom must never
  hold on an accepting run. As a doom it therefore applied only with an empty good set, where it gives the
  extractor nothing; the leftover relativised terms (`C_rec` level 0's positions, 2^-128.75; its MCA, 2^-130.0 per
  fold round) did not fit the 2^-132 luck budget beside a doom at `εS`. That version kept `C_rec` in UD. The fix
  (this version) charges nothing twice: drop the doom, and use the relativised invariant as the complement of
  luck, with the whole `εS` for its escapes.
- **The second `C_rec` level alone cost `V` time.** It saves 97.8 KB of `π`, but each opening had its own
  position-bit classes, so it added 358 BITS evaluations and +12.5 ms per check (`Φ̃` sweep, table sumcheck, bus
  final). Sharing the classes across openings (EV-DIET) removed that: 4,299 → 2,851 evaluations.
- **`KS` at 2^14 rows.** Its GKR, output claim and link save 0.113 s per step on the dev VM [measured], under the
  0.12 s that would pay for re-freezing the layout, and ≈ 0.04–0.06 s on Zen 4 [e].
- **relay-echo's chain kernel on the dev VM.** 422–507 ns per chain step against leanVM's `keccak_f` loop at
  293–298 (2^20 steps, one CPU), so the run-time choice keeps leanVM's kernel there; it is shipped because Zen 4
  may rank them the other way.
- **Johnson from BCIKS20's bound.** Its Johnson-radius theorem gives correlated agreement, not the mutual form
  WHIR needs, and is a `sorry` in ArkLib at our pin. With its size, `C_main`'s level 0 would need 297 queries,
  more than UD's [model].
- **Witness-sending nodes over SNARK leaves.** Each leaf is ≥ 0.75 MB of `(π, tr)`, so the 64 MiB cap
  breaks near step 85 (step 30 in UD), and the mean `|π|` of ≈ 36 MB gives `S ≥ 60`. Recursion is
  necessary.
- **Step 1 as one SNARK over two chains.** That needs a 2^27 commitment (≈ 14.6 GiB), more than 11 GiB.
- **leanVM's VM guest as the circuit.** Guest correctness is 300 k+ lines of proofs, and a 2^20 chain is
  2^27–2^28 cycles, past `MAX_MU = 28`. A flat gate list fails too: `V` would evaluate fixed columns of
  ≥ 2^20 rows.
- **Committing the whole chain row.** v1 committed `in`, `mid` and `Y` of all 2^20 chain rows (3,456 bits a row)
  and needed `C_main` at 2^26; gating the link (pr11-2f57ce79224a) made the GKR scale with `n` but kept that commit. The tape
  commits 256 bits a row and makes every input virtual, which is what lets `C_main` drop to 2^24. Committing `mid`
  at depth 12 instead of a depth-24 GKR keeps 2^26 [e].
- **A cheaper χ layer or one field.** Three design studies found no layer cheaper than leanVM's RMFE layer, and
  three found that `K = GF(2^64)` alone cannot carry 2^-128 per challenge (lifts, repetition and mixing are
  forkable at ≈ 2^-64 per query).
- **The `0x43` byte shift** is not `K`-linear (see Idea). It is proved bitwise, with ring switching, and
  the BITS tables handle the small unaligned prefixes.
- **The in-circuit self-evaluation** of fixed columns needs ≥ 1.5–2.5 M extra words: 1,160 columns,
  25 k loop terms and 56 k BITS monomials. **Plain deferral** to the parent has no sound fold challenge.
  Both were replaced by the self-fold accumulator (A23).
- **`C_rec`'s direct final check** cost ≥ 3.28 M words. It was dropped; ε and `Ex` are unchanged, since
  WHIR's final-level check has the same postcondition.
- **Ungrouped tables** would send 9,806 evaluations instead of 440. The final count is still 3,805
  (24 B each in `π`), mostly from BITS (2,578).
- **The assembler fixpoint** (record ↦ program ↦ record) oscillated between 76 and 81 groups once
  `Q_arith` was complete. Padding `Q` to the record made it converge (P20 +16 k words).
- **Kernel-deciding the whole program.** `mergeSort` is well-founded recursion, and a structural sort is
  OOM-killed at 12 GB. This is why A24 exists. Cheaper decide forms cut the rest from 42 to 13 s (`SLokF`
  16.1 → 1.2 s; per-block position lanes 20.1 → 6.5 s).
- **The extractor's FS replay by query prefix** was unsound: abandoned branches share prefixes. The replay
  now uses exact full queries.
- **Two statement bugs found while proving.** A WHIR phase's doom did not imply residual consistency; it
  was fixed with a joined residual doom. `ext_eq` as an equality is false outside `Ex`'s domain (an entry
  of ≥ 2^64 bytes); it became `(∃ w, Ex = some w ∧ Rel) ∨ Ex = S.Ex`.
- **Lean 4.35 → 4.34.1.** 70 leanVM modules compiled unchanged. Three failed on pin drift: ArkLib's
  Johnson API, the BF64 evaluation drift (CompPoly `572f9973` vs `e28da348`) and `.trans` resolving to
  `Function.trans`.
- **Build time.**
  - An RMFE `decide +kernel` went from 61 s / 8.5 GB to 3–4 s, by checking rows on `ℕ` rather than
    parities in `List Bool`.
  - A `Vector.replicate (2^19)` evaluated by the kernel had cost 78 s.
  - `congr 1` on field terms costs 5–31 s each.
  - Every module pays ≈ 3 CPU-s just to import.
  - Together these cut the clean build from 458 to 386 s and from 918 to 847 s at two stages, and the peak
    from 9.6 to 3.6 GiB.
- **The V target.** V was 0.34 s before `Q_arith` was complete and 0.5 s after: 84 groups, 1,226 fixed
  columns, 4,199 evaluations. The `Φ̃` sweep grew from 65 to 160 ms.
- **Testing v4 without the machine.** LLVM auto-vectorised std's start-up with GFNI, so v4 raises SIGILL
  on the dev VM even for `info`. Under Intel SDE, v4's P8 proof is byte-identical to v2's. `prover setup`
  self-tests each variant against v2's digest and caps the dispatch.

## What to try next

1. **The sponge into the tape.** `KS`'s own GKR (two 12-round segments), its committed `in`/`mid` columns and
   its link would go: the sponge rows join the tape as rows `2^20 + j`, with their inputs virtual
   (`cont_j·Y[j−1] + Msg[j]`). Expected: ≈ −0.4 s of fixed prover time, ≈ −0.8 M circuit words, one slice claim on
   `C_rec` [e].
2. **Prover levers that touch the certificate** (dev VM, ΔP̄ [model]): a cheaper Keccak GKR front end for the tape
   and `KS` (−0.44 s; 6–10 k lines of Lean), `C_main` halved (−0.33 s; needs a smaller node program first), the
   recursion-table build off the critical path (≤ −0.12 s).
3. **Exact-budget query counts and larger caps.** The exact budget (`εS = 7·2^-131`) could save a query or two on
   some levels, and larger caps trade cap bytes for path bytes. Caps are part of the certificate's level
   configurations, so this reopens their facts.
4. **`V`.** It is now arithmetic-bound. The GKR layers' weight vector kept symbolic (θρπ-transposes of a rank-1
   tensor) until the final claim: −15–20 ms [e], or −5–10 ms with array plumbing only. `C_main`'s WHIR claim
   weights (29 ms). Fewer evaluations: merging the small groups (≈ −340 [e]; merged groups need padding rows,
   which today's bus proofs exclude, 1–2 k lines); the 46 array address and 15 constant `k`/`k'` columns as
   closed forms (≈ −61; `V` computes them and `Q` replays them, a protocol change).
5. **Prover speed.** The `C_main` commit is bound by the oracle's Merkle hashing (≈ 3.7 of its 4.8 CPU-s at 2^17); a
   wider leaf or node would cut it. The FS-ordered per-layer work of the GKRs is ≈ 2 ms per layer, ≈ 0.15–0.2 s per tape.
   The recursion-table build's serial BITS fixpoint (2 × ≈ 0.03 s) could recompute only the rows that depend on
   BITS outputs. #13's `every` = 2 at 8 threads is untested here.
6. **Fewer guarded facts.** A structural, kernel-friendly table builder would let the kernel decide `wf`,
   grouping and claim well-formedness. That would remove `staticOkB` and 1.5 s of start-up.
7. **Left unapplied.**
   - drop v1's dead chain-table and shift-link modules, and the UD `C_rec` certificate helpers that `certified`
     no longer uses, from the closure (build and kernel time); split `openRec_P20`'s 7 s `decide` per segment;
   - `Q_link`'s node-half selection as one degree-2 assertion (−0.35 M);
   - `C_rec`'s zero columns as free table space;
   - a Rust test verifier;
   - the extractor's serial build chain.
