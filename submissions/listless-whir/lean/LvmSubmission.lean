# The submission and its certificate from named obligations

`subWith VS E ext` is the submission with

* `V := Vwith VS` (`'S'` → `VS`, otherwise the witness-sending decision, `LvmVerifier`);
* `P := encodeF` (the `W` kind; `δ = 0`, `LvmVerifier.complete`);
* `E`, `ext`: the extractor's specification and program (WP-13a: `Eden … (extIRWith piSz dec)`
  on the domain, the search/`W` branch outside it);
* `ε = 2^-128` and `δ = 0` as casts from `ℚ≥0` (gate rule 4), `qV = 16384`,
  `fuel t = 2^46 + 2^13 t` (`Lvm.X.fuel`).

**`certificate_subWith`**: the contract's `Certificate (subWith VS E ext)` from five obligations,
whose statements are final (they are generic in `VS`, `E`, `ext`; the final assembly instantiates
them):

| name | statement | owner |
|---|---|---|
| `hq` | `∀ H vk c π, isS π → |(VS vk c π).queries H| ≤ qVlvm` | WP-11a driver / WP-14 |
| `hc` | `Computes ext E Lvm.X.fuel` | WP-13a |
| `hsz` | `ext.body.size ≤ progCap` | WP-13a |
| `hEW` | `∀ c π L, isS π = false → E c π L = decode π` | WP-13a (FR `ext_W`) |
| `hS` | `∀ vk, SSound VS E vk` | WP-14 (`LvmCertS`), WP-13a (`E = Ex`) |

**`SSound VS E vk`**: a scheme `Sc` (WP-5 `Scheme`) and a knowledge certificate
`K : KCert Sc (Rel (accV VS vk))` with `εFS K ≤ 2^-128`, such that `VS` accepting an `'S'` proof on a
log implies `Sc.V` accepting it (`KState.congrV`'s condition), and `E` equal to `Sc.Ex K.ext` on
accepted `'S'` proofs over logs of potential below `1` (`μ K L < 1`: no bad entry, and the replayed
history is outside doom and luck, `LvmCertSGood.final_good`), or else a witness of the relation
(FR's search branch outside the domain). The proof is `KState.congr` on `kstate_of_kcert K`, then `KState.mono` and
`KState.ks`.

The current instance and its open obligations are in `LvmSubmissionS`.
