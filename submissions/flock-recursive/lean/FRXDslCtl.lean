/-! ## Controls (kernel-checked)

A toy program on the tape `[3, 5, 7, 9]` (a count, then the words): for each word, read it,
store it to the heap and load it back, `xor` it into an accumulator and output it; then output
the accumulator. Memory `260` words, no memory per tape word.

* Positive: the contract's interpreter outputs `[5, 7, 9, 11]` within `260 + 80` fuel
  (`toy_run`), as `semXIR` says (`toy_sem`), and `80 = steps + 8` is exact (`toy_run_short`);
  `run_toProg`'s hypotheses hold on it (`toy_wf`, `toy_bounds`, `toy_run_thm`); `cost` is
  above the exact count (`toy_steps_le`); `size_compile` (`toy_size`).
* Negative (**an under-declared cost**): the same loop declared with the constant cap `1`
  (`toyBad`) has `cost toyBad 4 = 34`, but the program does not halt within `260 + 34 + 8`
  (`toyBad_short`): the bounds hypothesis of `run_toProg` fails (`toyBad_not_bounds`) and
  cannot be dropped.
* The clamp of `loopK`: with `K = 2` the loop runs twice on the same tape (`toyK_run`), and the
  cost bound holds with no hypothesis (`toyK_steps`).
* The store guard: a store to register `1` (`cBase`) is dropped (`toyG_run`).
